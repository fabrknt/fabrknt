---

## Cross-Chain Strategy

### Strategic Positioning

**"Solana-First, Cross-Chain Enabled"**

Fabriquant maintains leadership in Solana's parallel execution while expanding portable components (Guard, Risk, Flow, Patterns) to EVM chains. This hybrid approach maximizes market opportunity while preserving competitive differentiation.

### Why Cross-Chain?

#### Market Opportunity

1. **4x Market Expansion**

    - Solana: 50,000 developers, $100B TVL potential
    - EVM: 200,000 developers, $200B+ TVL
    - Combined: 250,000 developers, $300B+ TVL

2. **Enterprise Demand**

    - Multi-chain protocols prefer unified solutions
    - Enterprise deals 2-3x larger with cross-chain support
    - Reduces single-chain risk for customers

3. **Competitive Positioning**
    - No strong cross-chain execution layer exists
    - First-mover advantage with portable components
    - Solana expertise differentiates from EVM-only tools

### Portable Components Strategy

#### High Priority (80% Portable)

1. **Guard (Security Layer)**

    - **Portability**: ~80% logic is chain-agnostic
    - **Chain-Specific**: Pattern detection (Solana instructions vs EVM calls)
    - **Market Need**: Universal security demand
    - **Revenue Potential**: High (enterprise security)
    - **Timeline**: Q3 2025

2. **Risk (Pulsar)**

    - **Portability**: ~90% logic is chain-agnostic
    - **Chain-Specific**: Oracle integrations, asset formats
    - **Market Need**: Universal risk assessment
    - **Revenue Potential**: High (institutional demand)
    - **Timeline**: Q3 2025

3. **Flow (Liquidity Routing)**

    - **Portability**: Concepts transfer, implementations differ
    - **Chain-Specific**: DEX integrations (Solana vs Uniswap/Curve)
    - **Market Need**: Multi-DEX routing on all chains
    - **Revenue Potential**: Medium-High (DeFi protocols)
    - **Timeline**: Q4 2025

4. **Pattern Library**
    - **Portability**: ~70% patterns are chain-agnostic
    - **Chain-Specific**: Implementation details
    - **Market Need**: Reusable execution patterns
    - **Revenue Potential**: Medium (developer tools)
    - **Timeline**: Q4 2025

#### Solana-Specific (Maintain Leadership)

1. **Loom (Parallel Execution)**

    - **Solana-Only**: True parallel execution unique to Solana
    - **EVM Adaptation**: Focus on bundling/optimization (not parallelism)
    - **Differentiator**: Core competitive advantage
    - **Strategy**: Maintain Solana leadership, adapt for EVM L2s

2. **Privacy (ZK Compression)**
    - **Solana**: Light Protocol (native)
    - **EVM**: Multiple solutions (zkSync, Aztec, Polygon zkEVM)
    - **Strategy**: Support multiple ZK stacks, maintain Solana advantage

### Implementation Phases

-   EVM pattern library
-   Cross-chain liquidity access
-   Cross-chain arbitrage patterns
-   Unified API documentation

**Success Metrics**:

-   EVM: 500+ developers, 10+ protocol integrations
-   Revenue: $600K+ EVM revenue (Year 2)

### Technical Architecture

#### Chain Abstraction Layer

```typescript
// Unified chain interface
interface ChainAdapter {
    chain: "solana" | "ethereum" | "polygon" | "arbitrum";
    buildTransaction(tx: UnifiedTransaction): ChainTransaction;
    executeTransaction(tx: ChainTransaction): Promise<TransactionResult>;
    estimateCost(tx: ChainTransaction): Promise<bigint>;
}

// Portable components work with unified interface
class Guard {
    validateTransaction(
        tx: UnifiedTransaction,
        chain: ChainAdapter
    ): ValidationResult {
        // Chain-agnostic validation logic
        // Chain-specific patterns via adapter
    }
}
```

#### Component Portability Matrix

| Component    | Portability | Solana-Specific     | EVM-Specific             | Timeline |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------------- | ------------------------ | -------- |
| **Guard**    | 80%         | Pattern detection   | Reentrancy, flash loans  | Q3 2025  |
| **Risk**     | 90%         | Oracle integrations | Chainlink, asset formats | Q3 2025  |
| **Flow**     | 60%         | DEX integrations    | Uniswap, Curve routing   | Q4 2025  |
| **Patterns** | 70%         | Implementation      | EVM patterns             | Q4 2025  |
| **Loom**     | 20%         | Parallel execution  | Bundling only            | TBD      |
| **Privacy**  | 30%         | Light Protocol      | Multiple ZK stacks       | TBD      |
